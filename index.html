        <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) with headquarter in Mumbai was <b>established in 1988 </b>under the resolution of the government of India. The board was introduced with the primary role of observing the
            activities
            of the stock market.</p>
        <p>But the increasing fraud and malfunctioning in the stock market in the later years arouse the need to establish a firm that would listen to the grievances of traders and investors.</p>

        <p>With the growing years, the government observes the decrease in figures in the share market. On analysis of the reason, the government decided to establish an
            organization that works as a regulator of the securities market in the country.</p>
        <p>Finally, SEBI came into force on <b>January 31, 1992</b>, as the statutory body as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. With this, the body starts regulating the matters of stock exchanges, mutual
            funds, etc in the financial market.</p>
        <p>To get into a trade, it is essential for brokers to get registered with it.</p>
        <p>Currently, the new broker Orril Trade, registered under SEBI to offer the broker services to its customer. It is a discount broker offering the provision to trade in
            different segments.</p>
