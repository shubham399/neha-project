        <p>The following are some of the major functions of SEBI that help in creating a safe and transparent environment for investors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Safeguard the Interests of Traders and Investors</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since traders are the base of the capital markets, their major responsibility is to protect their interests and make sure that none of the investors become the victim of any trade fraud. For this, it organizes certain seminars and events
            from time to time that helps in educating both traders and investors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Limit Price Rigging</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b> </b>Since SEBI came into force to stop manipulated huge fluctuation. Although fluctuation is the trend of the financial market sometimes some of them are already fixed (price rigging) by the corporate or group of corporate.
            Such fluctuations resulted in the huge loss of money of the investors.</p>
        <p>To stop such incidents of price rigging SEBI plays an effective role. It keeps surveillance on such cases. One of the approaches of SEBI to prevent it is the introduction of circuits.</p>
        <p>On analysis of the closing figure of the day before, the circuit also called the threshold is defined by the SEBI. If the security price goes down beyond the circuit value, the circuit breaker role comes into play and the trade of that
            particular security is halted for hours or for the whole day.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Prevent Insider Trading</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b> </b>The companyâ€™s stock price fluctuation is highly affected by the pre-announcement or any early news within the company. Coming across such news, some of the employees within the company sell or buy the company security
            beforehand.</p>
        <p>This type of trading is called <b>insider trading</b>.</p>
        <p>To prevent it, SEBI blocks the trust of the listed companies and the employee welfare schemes that prevent them from purchasing their own shares from the secondary market.</p>
        <p>Also, according to the SEBI guidelines, the listed companies need to disclose their employee&#8217;s benefits schemes include the stock purchase and make them align as per the ESOS and ESPS guidelines.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Financial Intermediates</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>SEBI is the intermediate body in the stock market whose responsibility is to ensure that all the market transactions take place smoothly and securely. Thus, it played a key role in the capital market and monitor every activity of
            financial intermediate like broker, sub-broker, etc</p>
